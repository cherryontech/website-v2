        <p>
          We acknowledge that the work of CherryOnTech takes place on the traditional, stolen, and
          ancestral lands of Indigenous Peoples across Turtle Island, known today as Canada and the
          United States. We honour the original caretakers of these lands and recognize their
          enduring connection to them. As we build inclusive tech spaces, we commit to learning
          from Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and relating.
